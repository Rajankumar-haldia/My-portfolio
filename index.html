            <h3>Project 3: Weather Application </h3>
            <p>I have built a  weather application is a digital tool that provides real-time weather updates and forecasts for specific locations. It uses APIs like OpenWeatherMap to fetch data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The app can display current weather, hourly updates, and multi-day forecasts, and often includes interactive features like location search or unit conversions (Celsius/Fahrenheit). It helps users plan their activities based on accurate weather information..</p>
